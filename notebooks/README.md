# Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction Pipeline

*note - Notebook was refined from its original form, does not contain output for code cells - yet*

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting healthcare appointment no-shows. The pipeline is split across three notebooks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the ML workflow.

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline (`01_data_processing_pipeline.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Initial data cleaning and validation
- **Key Features**:
  - Robust data validation framework
  - Intelligent data cleaning with domain-specific rules
  - Memory-efficient data type optimization
  - Comprehensive data quality reporting

### 2. Feature Engineering (`02_advanced_feature_engineering.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Advanced feature creation and transformation
- **Key Features**:
  - Temporal feature extraction
  - Patient history aggregation
  - Department-level statistics
  - Feature validation and selection

### 3. Model Development (`03_model_development_and_evaluation.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Model training, evaluation, and interpretation
- **Key Features**:
  - Stacking ensemble architecture
  - Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
  - SHAP-based interpretability analysis
  - Error pattern investigation

## Important Note on Model Outputs

The notebooks currently use an anonymized sample dataset that has been stripped of predictive power to comply with healthcare data privacy requirements. As a result:

1. **Limited Model Performance**: 
   - The actual predictive performance metrics may not be representative
   - Cross-validation scores and ROC-AUC values should be considered illustrative
   - Feature importance rankings are for demonstration purposes

2. **Visualization Constraints**:
   - SHAP plots may show random patterns due to anonymized features
   - Confidence distributions might not reflect real-world patterns
   - Error analysis visualizations are primarily for demonstration

3. **Why We Don't Show Outputs**:
   - To avoid confusion with non-representative results
   - To prevent misinterpretation of performance metrics
   - To maintain focus on the pipeline architecture and code quality

## Running the Pipeline

1. Execute notebooks in sequence (01 → 02 → 03)
2. Each notebook saves its outputs for the next stage
3. Intermediate data is stored in the `data` directory
4. Model artifacts are saved in the project root
