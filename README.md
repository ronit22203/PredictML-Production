# PredictML-Production: Hospital No-Show Prediction System

> A full-stack, production-ready ML system for predicting patient appointment no-shows — built for real-world deployment at healthcare ops scale.

## Problem Statement

Missed appointments cost hospitals money, overload staff, and waste resources.  
This project predicts the likelihood of a patient **not showing up** for their appointment using historical booking, demographic, and temporal features — enabling proactive rescheduling and better resource allocation.

---

## Approach & Features

- Cleaned **malformed & duplicate rows**, filtered invalid `AppointmentIds`
- Engineered **temporal features** (e.g., days until appointment, booking delay)
- Extracted:
  - Day-of-week effects
  - Age groups
  - Lead time buckets
  - Branch-wise breakdowns (e.g., BS, DE, NS, BD)
  - No-show frequency by patient

---

## 🔍 Models Trained

- `Logistic Regression`: baseline
- `Random Forest`: interpretable and stable
- `XGBoost`: tuned using `scale_pos_weight` for class imbalance

## ⚖️ Metrics (Best Model: XGBoost)

| Metric               | Value      |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Recall (No-Show)** | ~90%       |
| Precision            | ~50%       |
| F1 Score             | ~60%       |
| AUC-ROC              | 0.69+      |
| Log Loss             | 0.62       |
| MCC                  | 0.26       |

> ⚠️ Optimized for **recall on the No-Show class**, to avoid missing at-risk cases even if precision drops.
